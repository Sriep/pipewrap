pIRS simulate,"pIRS is a program for simulating Illumina PE reads, with a series of characters generated by 
  Illumina sequencing platform, such as insert size distribution, sequencing error(substitution, 
  insertion, deletion), quality score and GC content-coverage bias. 
    As all know, the insert size follows a normal distribution, so users should set the mean value 
  and standard deviation. We usually set the standard deviation as 1/20 of the mean value. We 
  simulate the normal distribution by Box-Muller method. 
    The program simulates sequencing error, quality score and GC content-coverage bias according 
  to the empirical distribution profile. We provide some default profiles counted from lots of real 
  sequencing data.
    To simulate reads from diploid genome, users should simulate the diploid genome sequence firstly 
  by setting the ratio of heterozygosis SNP, heterozygosis InDel and structure variation. ",./pirs simulate,,1

stampy.py,"Stampy is a package for the mapping of short reads from illumina sequencing machines onto a reference genome. It's recommended for most workflows, including those for genomic resequencing, RNA-Seq and Chip-seq. Stampy excels in the mapping of reads containing that contain sequence variation relative to the reference, in particular for those containing insertions or deletions. It can map reads from a highly divergent species to a reference genome for instance. Stampy achieves high sensitivity and speed by using a fast hashing algorithm and a detailed statistical model. Stampy has the following features:

    Maps single, paired-end and mate pair Illumina reads to a reference genome
    Fast: about 20 Gbase per hour in hybrid mode (using BWA)
    Low memory footprint: 2.7 Gb shared memory for a 3Gbase genome
    High sensitivity for indels and divergent reads, up to 10-15%
    Low mapping bias for reads with SNPs
    Well calibrated mapping quality scores
    Input: Fastq and Fasta; gzipped or plain
    Output: SAM, Maq's map file
    Optionally calculates per-base alignment posteriors
    Optionally processes part of the input
    Handles reads of up to 4500 bases

varscan somatic,"somatic
This command calls variants and identifies their somatic status (Germline/LOH/Somatic) using pileup files from a matched tumor-normal pair.

	USAGE: java -jar VarScan.jar somatic [normal_pileup] [tumor_pileup] [output] OPTIONS
        normal_pileup - The SAMtools pileup file for Normal
        tumor_pileup - The SAMtools pileup file for Tumor
        output - Output base name for SNP and indel output

You can also give it a single mpileup file with normal and tumor data.

	
	USAGE: java -jar VarScan.jar somatic [normal-tumor.mpileup] [output] --mpileup 1 OPTIONS
        normal-tumor.mpileup - The SAMtools mpileup file with normal and then tumor
        output - Output base name for SNP and indel output

Both formats of the command share these common options:",java -jar  VarScan.v2.3.6.jar somatic,,1

Extract/print all or sub alignments in SAM or BAM format. If no region is specified, all the alignments will be printed; otherwise only alignments overlapping the specified regions will be output. An alignment may be given multiple times if it is overlapping several regions. A region can be presented, for example, in the following format: ‘chr2’ (the whole chr2), ‘chr2:1000000’ (region starting from 1,000,000bp) or ‘chr2:1,000,000-2,000,000’ (region between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000bp including the end points). The coordinate is 1-based. ",samtools view,,1
samtools sort,"samtools sort [-no] [-m maxMem] <in.bam> <out.prefix>

Sort alignments by leftmost coordinates. File <out.prefix>.bam will be created. This command may also create temporary files <out.prefix>.%d.bam when the whole alignment cannot be fitted into memory (controlled by option -m). ",samtools sort,,1

samtools mpileup,"samtools mpileup [-EBug] [-C capQcoef] [-r reg] [-f in.fa] [-l list] [-M capMapQ] [-Q minBaseQ] [-q minMapQ] in.bam [in2.bam [...]]

Generate BCF or pileup for one or multiple BAM files. Alignment records are grouped by sample identifiers in @RG header lines. If sample identifiers are absent, each input file is regarded as one sample.

In the pileup format (without -uor-g), each line represents a genomic position, consisting of chromosome name, coordinate, reference base, read bases, read qualities and alignment mapping qualities. Information on match, mismatch, indel, strand, mapping quality and start and end of a read are all encoded at the read base column. At this column, a dot stands for a match to the reference base on the forward strand, a comma for a match on the reverse strand, a ’>’ or ’<’ for a reference skip, ‘ACGTN’ for a mismatch on the forward strand and ‘acgtn’ for a mismatch on the reverse strand. A pattern ‘\+[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn]+’ indicates there is an insertion between this reference position and the next reference position. The length of the insertion is given by the integer in the pattern, followed by the inserted sequence. Similarly, a pattern ‘-[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn]+’ represents a deletion from the reference. The deleted bases will be presented as ‘*’ in the following lines. Also at the read base column, a symbol ‘^’ marks the start of a read. The ASCII of the character following ‘^’ minus 33 gives the mapping quality. A symbol ‘$’ marks the end of a read segment.",samtools mpileup,,1
pbsim,"1. About PBSIM
==============
PacBio sequencers produce two types of characteristic reads as below.
  Continuous Long Read (CLR)    : long and high error rate.
  Circular consensus Read (CCS) : short and low error rate.
We have developed a PacBio reads simulater (called PBSIM) in which
sampling-based and model-based simulations are implemented.",pbsim,,1
alchemy,"alchemy outputModel [ options ] Simulation with Alchemy 
alchemy is a bas.h5 simulator that produces files with lengths,
errors, and quality values modeled after other real sequencing runs. 
To simulate using alchemy, first build the empirical model files using
supporting programs, then simulate the desired number of bas.h5 files.
