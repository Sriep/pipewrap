./blasr,,string,Reads.fasta/bax.h5 genome.fasta,"   reads.fasta is a multi-fasta file of reads.  While any fasta file is valid input, it is preferable to use plx.h5 or bax.h5 files because they contain  more rich quality value information.
   reads.bax.h5|reads.plx.h5 Is the native output format in Hierarchical Data Format of  SMRT reads. This is the preferred input to blasr because rich quality value (insertion,deletion, and substitution quality values) information is  maintained.  The extra quality information improves variant detection and mapping  speed.",0,,,1,,

./blasr,-ctab ,string,printTupleCountTable output,"A table of tuple counts used to estimate match significance.  This is  by the program 'printTupleCountTable'.  While it is quick to generate on  the fly, if there are many invocations of blasr, it is useful to precompute the ctab.",1,,,2,,
./blasr,-regionTable ,string,Read region table,"Read in a read-region table in HDF format for masking portions of reads. This may be a single table if there is just one input file, or a fofn.  When a region table is specified, any region table inside  the reads.plx.h5 or reads.bax.h5 files are ignored.",1,,,2,,

./blasr,-noSortRefinedAlignments ,int,Sort refined alignemnts,"(false)  Once candidate alignments are generated and scored via sparse dynamic  programming, they are rescored using local alignment that accounts  for different error profiles. Resorting based on the local alignment may change the order the hits are returned.",1,,,2,,
./blasr,-allowAdjacentIndels,,Allow adjcent Indels,"When specified, adjacent insertion or deletions are allowed. Otherwise, adjacent   insertion and deletions are merged into one operation.  Using quality values to guide pairwise alignments may dictate that the higher probability alignment  contains adjacent insertions or deletions.  Current tools such as GATK do not permit  this and so they are not reported by default.",1,,,2,,

./blasr,-titleTable ,string,Table of sequence titles,"tab (NULL) Construct a table of reference sequence titles.  The reference sequences are  enumerated by row, 0,1,...

./blasr,-advanceExactMatches ,int,trick for speeding up alignments,"Another trick for speeding up alignments with match - E fewer anchors.  Rather than  finding anchors between the read and the genome at every position in the read,  when an anchor is found at position i in a read of length L, the next position  in a read to find an anchor is at i+L-E.  Use this when alignining already assembled contigs.",1,,,2,,
./blasr,-nCandidates ,int,Keep  candidates,n (10)  Keep up to 'n' candidates for the best alignment.  A large value of n will slow mapping because the slower dynamic programming steps are applied to more clusters of anchors   which can be a rate limiting step when reads are very long.,1,,,2,,

./blasr,-useQuality ,int,Use quality,"(false) Use substitution/insertion/deletion/merge quality values to score gap and    mismatch penalties in pairwise alignments.  Because the insertion and deletion  rates are much higher than substitution, this will make many alignments  favor an insertion/deletion over a substitution.  Naive consensus calling methods   will then often miss substitution polymorphisms. This option should be  used when calling consensus using the Quiver method.  Furthermore, when  not using quality values to score alignments, there will be a lower consensus  accuracy in homolymer regions.",1,,,2,,
